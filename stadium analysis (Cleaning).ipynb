We will determine which positions in the NFL are important by utilizing salary cap data for each NFL team between 2014-2020. After we have idenitifed the most significant positions for NFL teams, we will create a predictive model that examines the statistics for that given position and will predict the total wins an NFL franchise should have in that given season.\n"

    "Our main goal is to predict an NFL Franchise's total wins for a given season based on the essential positions we have idenfited: CB,WR,QB,DE,OLB. We will do this by creating a predictive model that analyzes the statistics for each position group. For example, it will know what a 14 win QB looks like based on the stastics for previous years, therefore if we plug in statistics for these position groups, we should be able to predict what an NFL Teams record will be. Questions we want to answer are: \"If an NFL franchise does not have one of these position groups in their top 5 % of market_cap, how do they perform\" \"How do teams perform without a QB in the top of their market cap?\" \"What statistics matter the most for each position?\". Ultimately, we want to be able to predict a teams wins based on what these 5 positions have historically done. "
